## üöÄ How to Contribute

### 1. Fork the Repository

Click "Fork" on [GitHub](https://github.com/khanhptnk/yrc), then clone your fork locally:

### 3. Make Your Changes

- Keep changes focused on a single issue or feature.
- Write clear, well-documented code using **type hints** and **NumPy-style docstrings**.
- Add or update **tests** under the `tests/` directory.
- Add or update **documentation** if needed (under `docs/`).

### 4. Code Formatting and Linting

We use [`ruff`](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for both **formatting** and **linting**.

Before committing, run:

```bash
ruff format .       # Auto-format your code
ruff check .        # Lint for style and logic errors
```

To automatically fix most lint errors:

```bash
ruff check . --fix
```

Make sure the test suite passes:

```bash
pytest
```

Include tests for any new functionality or bug fixes.
